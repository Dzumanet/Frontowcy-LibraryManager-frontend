# Library Manager

This application was created as the final project for the Frontowcy course.

## Project Status
Unfortunately, the project is not fully completed. The following elements are missing:

Unit tests and E2E tests.
User deletion functionality.
Some components are not properly modularized.
Lack of full responsiveness for mobile and desktop devices.
Despite these shortcomings, the application is functional and fulfills most of the intended features. Further improvements and development are planned.
